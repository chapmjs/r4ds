## 5.1 Introduction
Load libraries
```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)


```

see the data
```{r}
flights
```

## 5.2 Filter rows with filter

filter for flights on month == 1, day == 1
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

filter for flights (on month ==1, day == 1) and save to new object
```{r}
(jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1))
```


Common Error messages
```{r eval=FALSE }
filter(flights, month = 1)


# calculations are precise
sqrt(2) ^ 2 == 2

1 / 49 * 49 == 1

# so when comparing numebrs, use near()

near(sqrt(2)^2, 2)

near(1 / 49 * 49, 1)


```
## 5.2.2 Logical operators

![Complete set of Boolean operations.](./img/transform-logical.png)



How many flights left from NYC in Nov and Dec?
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)
nov_dec <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11,12))
```


How many flights were NOT delayed (on arrival or departure) by more than two hours?
```{r}
filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
# or
filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
```
